# Customer_Life_Time_Value
**"Customer lifetime value is how much money a customer will bring your brand throughout their entire time as a paying customer"**
At a glance, CLTV tells you how much a customer is worth to your brand and gives you insight into their overall value. From there, you’ll have a better understanding of how much you should be investing in customer retention going forward.  Not only that, but customer lifetime value clues you into whether or not you can expect certain customers to become repeat customers. If their customer lifetime value is high, chances are they’re fans of your brand and will continue to buy more of your products. If not, they’re likely just a passive customer who made a one-time purchase and will take extra effort to re-engage.
